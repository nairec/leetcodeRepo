# leetcodeRepo
A personal repository of each leetcode challenge that I solved with some explanations 

Each folder will containt, at minimum:
  - A .md file with the explanation of the challenge
  - The solution code
  - A .md file with the explanation fo the solution that I implemented

!- All solutions will be implemented in Python for the time being
